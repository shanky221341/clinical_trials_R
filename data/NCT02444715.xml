  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most frequent and life-threatening diseases in Europe. About four
      stroke events occur per day in Luxembourg alone, and about 30% of these patients are
      affected by recurrent stroke within the following five years. Thus, new methods of primary
      and secondary prevention are needed to better control lifestyle-related risk factors.

      The development and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle (smoking cessation, healthy
      nutrition, moderate physical exercises etc.) is a major objective concerning the primary and
      secondary prevention of cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases. CAPSYS is a computer-based
      lifestyle coaching system developed by researchers from the Public Research Centre (CRP)
      Henri Tudor in Luxembourg in collaboration with neurologists from the Centre Hospitalier de
      Luxembourg (CHL), which aims at supporting patients in performing appropriate behavior
      changes in order to minimize their individual risk factors. Patients can access CAPSYS by
      dialing a local-rate telephone number and answer to a set of previously known questions
      concerning their current nutrition, physical activity, blood pressure, smoking etc. In an
      interactive voice response approach, questions are issued by the system in natural language
      using text-to-speech, and the patient can provide the required values using the phone
      keypad. Based on the gathered values for each patient, the system automatically generates
      personalized verbal feedback at runtime and presents it to the patient during the phone
      dialog. Depending on the individual development of the patient's risk factors, the system
      feedback can contain advice for improvement, praise for healthy behavior and motivation to
      pursue a certain goal.

      The user acceptance and effectiveness of the CAPSYS system is evaluated in a six-month
      randomized controlled study with participants recruited at CHL's neurology department.

    <description>The QoL was measured using the standardised EQ-5D-5L instrument provided by the EuroQol Group.
In this context, the health value was specified by the participants on a subjective scale ranging from 0 (&quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;) to 100 (&quot;The best health you can imagine&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Usability: SUS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The usability of the intervention was assessed based on the standardised System Usability Scale (SUS).
SUS scores were not collected in the SC group because the SC participants were not using CAPSYS and hence were not able to assess its usability.
SUS questionnaires were missing, incomplete or invalid for 6 IC participants.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a &quot;quick and dirty&quot;, reliable tool for measuring the usability.   It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree.  Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, it allows to evaluate a wide variety of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications.
The total SUS score computed based on the responses provided to each of the 10 items can range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>

        <title>Usability: SUS Score</title>
        <description>The usability of the intervention was assessed based on the standardised System Usability Scale (SUS).
SUS scores were not collected in the SC group because the SC participants were not using CAPSYS and hence were not able to assess its usability.
SUS questionnaires were missing, incomplete or invalid for 6 IC participants.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a “quick and dirty”, reliable tool for measuring the usability.   It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree.  Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, it allows to evaluate a wide variety of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications.
The total SUS score computed based on the responses provided to each of the 10 items can range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>
