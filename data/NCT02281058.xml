  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease with evidence of CTLA-4 involvement.  We are
      performing a pilot study for the treatment of new onset or actively progressing vitiligo
      with abatacept to determine if weekly self-injections of medication lead to clinical
      improvement in vitiligo lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abatacept has been shown to decrease T cell activity and reduce symptoms associated with
      rheumatoid arthritis.  Similar pathways have been shown to be involved in vitiligo.
      Therefore, we are recruiting 10 adult patients with active vitiligo who meet specific
      inclusion and exclusion criteria to receive self-administered injections of abatacept weekly
      starting at week 0 and continuing until week 24.  A 32 week follow-up visit will be
      performed to evaluate secondary endpoints as well.  We will be monitoring patients to see if
      skin lesions of vitiligo stop spreading and start to repigment with continued treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-pregnant individuals ages 18 and older with a diagnosis of actively progressive
             skin lesions of clinically diagnosed vitiligo covering at 5% or great body surface
             area (defined as development of new lesions or worsening of existing lesions within
             the past 6 months) not receiving immune suppressive treatment.  Both subjects who
             have received at least one therapy in the past  and subjects currently receiving
             treatment at the time of screening will be eligible providing they undergo a wash out
             period prior to starting the study (2 weeks for topical agents and systemic agents
             with short half lives, 1 month for phototherapy)

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an acceptable method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 10 weeks after
             the last dose of study drug in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized

          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test result (minimum sensitivity
             25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 0 to 48 hours before the first dose of
             study drug

          -  Women must not be breast-feeding

          -  Sexually active fertile men must use effective birth control if their partners are

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding patients

          -  Patients with segmental, acrofacial, or universal vitiligo

          -  Patients with evidence of poliosis (white hairs) within the majority (&gt;50%) of their
             vitiligo lesions

          -  Patients currently on any other systemic biologic medication, current use of
             Abatacept, or any other systemic biologic medication within 2 months of study (or
             within 5 half-lives of last dose of drug)

          -  Use of systemic immunosuppressive agent within 2 weeks prior to initiation of
             Abatacept

          -  Use of potent topical steroids, topical tacrolimus or pimecrolimus within 2 weeks
             prior to initiation of Abatacept

          -  Receiving concomitant immune modulating therapy (see concomitant medications, section
             8.6).  Subjects receiving such agents at screening may be eligible to enroll

             short half lives

          -  Subjects who are impaired, incapacitated, or incapable of completing study-related

             disease, whether or not related to vitiligo and which, in the opinion of the

             study

          -  Subjects with a history of cancer in the last 5 years, other than non-melanoma skin
             cell cancers cured by local resection or carcinoma in situ. Existing non-melanoma
