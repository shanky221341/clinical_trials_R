  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photocil is a topical drug (cream) that selectively delivers Narrow Band - Ultraviolet B
      (NB-UVB) therapy when exposed to sunlight. Photocil is intended to help protect users from
      non-therapeutic Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation while selectively passing wavelengths of light
      in the NB-UVB range with peak transmission of 308nm. The aim of the study is to assess the
      safety and efficacy of Photocil in the treatment of vitiligo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NB-UVB phototherapy is a common treatment for patients with psoriasis, and has been reported
      to be safe and effective in numerous clinical trials. Clinical trials have reported
      achievement of Vitiligo Area Severity Index (VASI)-75 in 50-70% of patients after 4-6 weeks
      of NB-UVB treatment.

      Many drawbacks limit patients compliance, access, and acceptance of traditional NB-UVB
      phototherapy. The strict treatment regimen (2-3 sessions per week for an average of 12 weeks
      or more) performed at a specialized phototherapy clinic combined with high cost and low or
      no reimbursement make compliance and access a major drawback.

      In order to address the drawbacks of phototherapy, we developed a novel topical cream -
      Photocil - that selectively delivers NB-UVB therapy when exposed to sunlight. When used with
      natural sunlight, Photocil provides a convenient alternative to traditional clinic based
      phototherapy; thus, has the potential to dramatically increase patient compliance and
      treatment outcome.
